        <item><em>Whole Numbers </em>can be written with the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and are divisible by 1 with no remainder. </item>
        <item><em>Place Value: </em>In our decimal number system, the value of a digit depends on its place, or position, in the number. Each place has a value of 10 times the place to its right.
            \n\n A number in standard form is separated into groups of three digits using commas. Each of these groups is called a period.
            \n\n The idea of place value is at the heart of our number system. First, however, a symbol for nothing—our zero—had to be invented. Zero \"holds the place\" for a particular value, when no other digit goes in that position. For example, the number \"100\" in words means one hundred, no tens, and no ones. Without a symbol for nothing, our decimal number system wouldn\'t work.
            \n\n Beginning with the ones place at the right, each place value is multiplied by increasing powers of 10. For example, the value of the first place on the right is \"one\", the value of the place to the left of it is \"ten,\" which is 10 times 1. The place to the left of the tens place is hundreds, which is 10 times 10, and so forth.
            \n\n For easier readability, commas are used to separate each group of three digits, which is called a period. When a number is written in this form, it is said to be in \"standard form.\"

        <item>These are some definitions that you need to know for the GED: \n
            <ul>
                <li>The answer to an addition problem is called the <em><u>sum</u></em>. For example, in the problem
                    <em>9 + 5 = 14</em>, <em>14</em> is the <em>sum</em> of 9 and 5.</li>
                <li>The answer to a multiplication problem is called the <em><u>product</u></em>. For example, in the problem
                    <em>9 * 5 = 45</em>, <em>45</em> is the <em>product</em> of 9 and 5.</li>
                <li><em>Whole numbers</em> include 0 and all <em>positive</em> numbers. A <em>positive</em> number is any number
                    greater than 0.</li>
                <li>An <em>odd</em> number is defined as not evenly divisible by 2. The units digit of an odd number will always be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.
                    For example: 9, 47, and 2,400,513 are all odd numbers. The numbers 6 and 538 are not.</li>
                <li>An <em>even</em> number is defined as being evenly divisible by 2. The units digit of an even number has to be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
                    For example: 4, 52, and 386 are all even numbers. The numbers 3 and 423 are not.</li>
                <li><em>Consecutive numbers</em> are one after the other. For example, 12, 13, and 14 are consecutive numbers. Also, the next three consecutive odd numbers
                    following 13 are 15, 17, 19.</li>
                <li>A <em>prime</em> number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. For example, 17 is a prime number because
                    the only numbers that divide evenly into 17 are 17 and 1. However, 15 is not a prime number because aside from
                    15 and 1, 15 is also evenly divisible by 3 and 5.</li>
                <li>A <em>factor</em> is another word for divisor. A factor is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example,
                    5 is <em>a factor of</em> 15, and <em>the factors of</em> 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.</li>
            </ul>

        <item>The four basic operations in arithmetic are <em>addition, subtraction, multiplication,</em> and <em>division</em>. Read more about each below, then watch the animation for a step-by-step example of each.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Addition: </em>The answer to an addition problem is called the <em>sum</em>, or <em>total</em>. The symbol for an addition operation is the <em>+</em> sign.</li>
                <li><em>Subtraction: </em>The answer to a subtraction problem is called the <em>difference</em>. The symbol for the subtraction operation is the <em>-</em> sign. To find the difference between two numbers, you should put the larger number on top.</li>
                <li><em>Multiplication: </em>The answer to a multiplication problem is called the <em>product</em>. The <em>x</em> sign and the <em>*</em>, as well as a raised dot between two numbers, and numbers in parentheses with no signs in between all symbolize a multiplication operation.</li>
                <li><em>Division: </em>The answer to a division problem is called the <em>quotient</em>. The <em>&#x00F7;</em> sign, the <em>&#x27CC;</em> sign, and a slash all symbolize a division operation.</li>
